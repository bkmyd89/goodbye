# My Day in Coding

Today was a wonderful experience that started with a cat. He was really mad at me because I told him his _overwhelming garlic scent_ kept me awake during the night. He just looked at me when I told him to leave and so I left instead!

I decided to go for a walk in the neighborhood to meet some others cats. I met a nice one named Charlie and brought him home to see what my old cat would think. From there things took a turn for the worst, my old cat, named George, became jealous that this new cat did not have the scent of garlic on him. Perplexed, George left the house with Charlie to learn his ways. Along the journey of becoming clean the two cats made a few new friends:

      <td> Gretta </td>
      <td> Lola </td>
      <td> Henry </td>
      <td> Stripes </td>
      <td> Little One </td>
  </tr>
</table>

They decided to do some online shopping at [Kohl's](http://kohls.com) and snagged some new digs for his loving mom at home.
